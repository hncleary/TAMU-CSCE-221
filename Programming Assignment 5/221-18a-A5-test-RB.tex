\textbf{\Large{}Assignment~5 (40 pts)}{\Large{} }
\par\end{center}{\Large \par}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Program: Due April 10 at 11:59 pm }{\Large{}\medskip{}
}
\par\end{center}{\Large \par}

\textbf{Description:} You will be given an executive file, \texttt{RBTree},
and you will use it for all testing and running in this assignment
therefore you do not need to write any code here. Make sure that you
use the TAMU servers (\emph{compute}) to run this assignment.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How to run the program
\begin{enumerate}
\item To run all the test cases, type 

\texttt{./RBTree}
\item To print out the trees level by level, type

\texttt{./RBTree -o 1}

In place of \texttt{1} it can be any number \texttt{$\le12$} (but
don't go past 4 because it will print out too much for the terminal
to handle). This number is the number of tree levels to print out.
\item To test on a custom file, type

\texttt{./RBTree -f file\_name}

where \texttt{file\_name} must include the (relative) path to this
file (say, \texttt{data-files/7p}).
\end{enumerate}
\item Use the provided files to test the Red-Black and regular binary search
trees created using the same input. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a small input (the number of nodes less than 16) to compare a
Red-Black tree generated by the program with a Red-Black tree obtained
by hand. Include an evidence of these comparisons (pictures, screenshots,
etc).
\item Make \textcolor{black}{a table and}\textcolor{red}{{} }a plot showing
the average search cost (y-axis) versus the number of tree nodes (x-axis)
of all Red-Black trees created with the data used.
\begin{enumerate}
\item You should produce a graph with 6 plots: plots for the linear, perfect,
and random file type data for both the regular binary trees and the
Red-Black trees.
\item Your graph plots should include the data points from all $12$ input
files (from 1 to 12).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\noindent \begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Report (40 points)}
\par\end{flushleft}

Write and submit to eCampus a brief report that includes the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide a brief description, reason for building, and applications
of the Red-Black tree data structure and its operations.
\item Provide the upper bound on individual search cost in a Red-Black and
binary search tree in the worst case. Express this cost in terms of
big-O notation. See the lecture notes for more details. 
\item How can you justify that the computed average search costs for some
Red-Black trees is higher than for perfectly balanced binary search
trees? Does the formula below provide lower bound on the computed
average search costs for Red-Black trees? Justify your answer. 

\[
\sum_{d=0}^{\log_{2}(n+1)-1}2^{d}(d+1)/n\simeq((n+1)\cdot\log_{2}(n+1)/n)-1
\]
\item Include the table and plots of computed average search costs for Red-Black
and regular binary search trees discussed in the item 2 of the\textbf{\large{}
}\textbf{Description} part, together with the comparisons with theoretical
lower and upper bounds. Write your conclusion. 
\item Include the testing cases for the small input data (the number of
nodes less than 16) for the files selected by you in the report.
\item Summary. What have you learned by doing the assignment?
\end{enumerate}
